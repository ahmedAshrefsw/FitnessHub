				<h2>What to Eat Before AND After Your Workout</h2>
				<hr>
			</header>

			<p class="fs-13">For decades we all huddled in the corners of the gym slamming our post workout shakes in a sacrificial offering to the gainz gods. We had to get the protein in before the anabolic window was closed on us. This was part of the bro bible, it infused us to our core. Then we found out that the anabolic window probably wasn’t real and that you can get away with not eating for several hours. Many called this the death of nutrient timing… but they missed something. Well actually, a lot of somethings. They missed about 30 solid years of research showing that the important aspect of nutrient timing is before (and during) training, not after. Yes, if you are chasing maximal gains and optimal performance you better start thinking about what you are eating before you train.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>The World’s Most Ergogenic Aid</h2>
			<pre><p>Despite fancy formulations and trying to find the newest pre-workout supplement there is one thing that has repeatedly been demonstrated <br>to be a powerful ergogenic aid for long training sessions: The Mighty Carbohydrate.<br><br>Yes. I am telling you that pre workout carbohydrates are one of the best supplements on the planet for maximizing the quality of your <br>training. Here is the how and why of how this works and what makes carbohydrates so key for training.<br><br>When you start exercising at an even fairly modest intensity your body starts using muscle glycogen to fuel your training and as time <br>goes on you begin to use glucose from your blood to keep things moving along.<br><br>The glucose from your pre workout meal begins driving in your blood stream not too long after eating it and continues to show up <br>for 1-2 hours after you eat. This provides that additional fuel directly to muscle tissue and keeps your training going.<br><br>Armed with that knowledge we could probably guess that consuming carbohydrates right before or during training would increase performance <br>and training capacity? Well, that is exactly what the science shows. There are very clear performance benefits of consuming carbohydrates <br>before or during training.</p></pre>          

			<h2>Protein Makes Carbohydrates Even Better</h2>
			<pre><p>We just hammered the point that carbs are the bee’s knees for improving training capacity and increasing work volume, but it appears that <br>protein can make carbohydrates even better at increasing performance during training and might help augment recovery.<br><br>In terms of outcomes, consuming protein before training, especially when combined with carbohydrates has been shown to improve muscle growth. <br>Even without carbohydrates, consuming protein alone before training can improve muscle protein synthesis. So even if you aren’t slamming <br>back bananas or Gatorade, a little whey before training goes a long way.</p></pre>
			
			<h2>How Much Do I Need Before Training?</h2>
			<pre><p>So, now we know you need some carbohydrates and protein before training to maximize your training capacity, recovery, and your gainz. <br>But how many grams do you need to eat?<br><br>This can either be really, really complicated, or super easy depending on how crazy you want to get. To get ~95% of the benefit follow <br>this simple heuristic:<br><br>If you are training using a body part split, consume about 20 grams of protein and roughly 60 to 80 grams of carbohydrates around <br>30-60 minutes before training.<br><br>If you are training using a full body routine and it is an extended training session (>90 minutes), consume about 40 grams of protein <br>and roughly 120 to 160 grams of carbohydrates around 30-60 minutes before training.<br><br>It really doesn’t need to be much more complicated than that.</p></pre>
